### Account management

Here you can view your seed, view your addresses
(advanced users only), edit your account name, delete
your account, or add additional accounts.

### Adding additional accounts

Trinity provides multi-account support. You can store more
than one seed in your wallet. This enables you to split your
funds between multiple seeds and manage them from within
the same application.

Do you have more than one seed in your Trinity wallet? You can
swap between accounts by pressing the dropdown at the top of
the screen on mobile or in the sidebar on desktop.

> Please ensure you have at least one proper seed backup
> for each new seed you create.

### Change password

Change your account password.

### Advanced Settings

We discourage changing any of the advanced user settings.
Most users only come here to perform snapshot transitions
or a manual sync. These tasks should work automatically
under normal conditions.

### Nodes

Trinity provides a built-in node-balancing service for
optimal performance. Every time you open your wallet, it
selects a healthy node with a low current load.

> _Advanced users only_: If you wish to turn off node-balancing, please
> head to the **Select node** page in **Advanced settings**. It is also
> possible to add your own **custom node**.

### Automatic Promotion/Reattachment

To ensure transactions are confirmed on the Tangle, it can be
necessary to promote or reattach. When possible, Trinity will
do this automatically.

_Advanced users only_: to enable **manual
promotion/reattachment**, turn on **Expert** mode in the settings. Enabling manual promotion/reattachment will not
disable the automatic promotion/reattachment feature.

> Trinity does not promote/reattach transfers if the application
> is minimised. Currently automatic promotion/reattachment only takes
> place when the app is open.

### Snapshot Transition:

Following a snapshot, users must perform a snapshot transition.

/>

The snapshot transition function is located in **Advanced settings**.
Every so often, a snapshot is performed on the Tangle. Snapshots reduce
the size of the Tangle database. All transaction data is deleted and
only non-zero address balances are retained. Because Trinity is stateful,
it will store a copy of your transactional history after a snapshot.
This means that after the snapshot erases transaction data from the Tangle,
you still see them in your wallet.

### Manual Sync:

If your balance or history appears incorrect, a manual sync can fix it.

With Manual Sync Trinity double-checks your history and balances with
the IOTA network. This makes sure your wallet is properly synced.
The action may take a while, so please be patient and keep Trinity
in the foreground!
